Computational thinking is the process involved in formulating an issue and conveying a computer-like response (Beecher 2017).
This is done by reformulating a challenging problem into one we can solve through different processes like decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithms (Wing 2006). 
Computational Thinking is a fundamental skill for every 21st century person as it is essential for learning (Mazzone 2020).</p>

<p>There are four main processes in Computational Thinking. 
   The first is decomposition which is the breakdown of problems into smaller processes to allow us to understand and execute them better. 
   Abstraction is done by preserving important information and disregarding the irrelevant information. 
   Pattern recognition is done by noticing similarities or differences that will help make predictions and lead to shortcuts. 
   Lastly Algorithms are sequences of steps for executing solutions. (Wang 2006). </p> 
<p>Computational Thinking is essential for studying as it allows us to use processes like those above to turn complex issues into those which we can comprehend. 
   It is also essential for your career of choice as the skill requirements for modern-day businesses are evolving, problem solving skills are essential for employees to improve the productivity of a business. 
   Skills like this are beneficial to careers in all sectors as workplaces want employees who take an active role in thinking problems through and creating solutions (Snalune 2015).  
   As technology becomes more complex, we need to understand how to collect data, simplify it and how it can be used in decision making, therefore it is essential with data increasing in its sophistication that workforces are able to thrive in the new age of technology (Redaction 2018).</p>
