 <p> Prior to completing this module, I was under the impression that computational thinking was exclusive to only computer scientists and that it would be extremely complicated. 
    However, through this assignment and reflection I have been able to understand that it can be used in everyday aspects of life, even by my own self. 
    The core processes allow us to break down difficult problems and provide us with efficient ways of thinking.
    This can be used in everyday learning, a process that I have done with this assignment, disregarding the unimportant aspects of information, and highlighting relevant facts to emphasise significant points within these essays (Teaching London Computing 2021). 
    Computational thinking is the process in which human beings solve problems, a process we may not recognise ourselves doing every day.
    When losing an item of clothing we often retrace our steps for the day and even when making a cup of tea we have a set pattern that we follow, these are considered parts of computational thinking (J.M.Wing 2006). 
    Computational thinking is a fundamental skill, J.M. Wing describes it in her article as <i> “something every human being must know to function in modern day society”.</i> 
    This has been reflected in the United Kingdom as it has now become mandatory in the computing curriculum preparing students to become independent learners and future designers of innovative technology (Teaching London Computing 2021).</p>

p>This module has had an immense impact on my learning, as we learn not only knowledge but an exclusive way of thinking and solving problems, allowing us to further appreciate technology. 
From this module I will utilise the processes within computational thinking like decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithms in my wider learning to be able to think and problem solve efficiently. 
I will be able to apply this when learning Python and JavaScript in the Fundamentals of programming module as they require all the processes within computational thinking. 
Computational thinking has also helped me develop skills that are appealing to future employers and will increase career prospects as it has become an essential skill in this industry (Snalune 2015).
In conclusion, I am pleased that this was the first module of the MSc Computing course as the computational thinking module is highly applicable to any of the other modules, I will be able to utilise the processes throughout my learning on this course as well, in everyday life processes and in my chosen field in the future.
